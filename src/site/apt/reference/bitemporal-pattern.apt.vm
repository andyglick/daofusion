  Temporal database is a database with built-in time aspects, e.g. a temporal data model and a temporal version of structured query language.
  Typical application deals with current knowledge relevant to current time. User performs actions on objects, entities and expects them to update their internal state appropriatelly. In terms of time, we are talking about time as a value present in a model (e.g. date of birth) similarly to any other attribute (e.g. name).
  Temporal category of problems to solve arises as soon as user wants to know the state of the object before he/she performed the action. This means to track the state of entity in time. In other words, given any time application should present user a state of entity or a state of entire entity graph. 
  More specifically the temporal aspects usually include valid-time and transaction-time. These attributes go together to form bitemporal data.

    * Valid time denotes the time period during which a fact is true with respect to the real world.

    * Transaction time is the time period during which a fact is stored in the database.

    * Bitemporal data combines both Valid and Transaction Time.

  The implementation in this project is based on work done by Erwin Vervaet and Christophe Vanfleteren [2].  Their implementation was extended to fit more in annotation based setup.
  <<<Bitemporal>>> is the main interface to understand. Any object implmenting <<<Bitemporal>>> is ment to track value in two dimensions:

  * Validity interval: indicates when the value was valid
    
  * Recording interval: indicates when the value was known (also known as transaction interval)

  []

  In most cases, application level should not directly implement this interface, but should instead wrap existing value classes bitemporally using a specific <<<BitemporalWrapper>>>. The example of such implementation is shown in folowing snippet:

%{code-snippet|brush-autodetect=1|file=src/site/snippet/reference/bitemporal-bitemporal-wrapper.java}

  This snippet shows bitemporal wrapper for Long value. This bitemporal wrapper tracks long values in time. To clarify usage, next snippet shows entity Person with bitemporal property tracking number of childrens in time. Bitemporal values are internally stored in collection:

%{code-snippet|brush-autodetect=1|file=src/site/snippet/reference/bitemporal-entity.java}


* {Manipulating Bitemporal Collections}

  To access bitemporal values one will use <<<BitemporalProperty>>>. It's a convenient class to access values in bitemporal collection:

  * access value known and valid on given time

  * access history of values as known on given time

  * access evolution of values as valid on given time
  
  []

  In order to prevent the API pollution with tuple of dates (known on and valid on), the decision was made to set known on date value via <<<TimeUtils.setReference(Date recordAt)>>> method. The value is stored in <<<ThreadLocal>>> so it's used everywhere in the scope of the running thread. 

%{code-snippet|brush-autodetect=1|file=src/site/snippet/reference/bitemporal-property.java}

  Bitemporal property needs <<<ValueAccessor>>> as a factory to bind specific value into bitemporal wrapper and retrieve the value from bitemporal wrapper. So in our example the value accessor for Long value and it's BitemporalLong:

%{code-snippet|brush-autodetect=1|file=src/site/snippet/reference/bitemporal-value-accessor.java}

  to be specific, LongBitemporalProperty will look like this:


%{code-snippet|brush-autodetect=1|file=src/site/snippet/reference/bitemporal-long-property.java}
