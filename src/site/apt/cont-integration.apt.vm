Continuous integration
  
  ${df} uses an internal {{{http://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/} TeamCity}} {{{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration} continuous integration}} system
  which reacts to changes in the {{{source-repository.html} source code repository}}:
  
  * trunk (current development)
  
  * maintenance branches
  
  []
  
  This ensures that problems are detected early, with all standard {{{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing} unit tests}} and {{{./reference/integration-tests.html} integration tests}}
  executed after changes caused the project to be rebuilt from scratch.
  
* Best practices
  
  ${df} developers are encouraged to follow these practices when committing their changes:
  
  * all changes must be buildable (no compile errors)
  
  * commit often (avoid big-bang commits)
