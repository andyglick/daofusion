${df} news
  
* 2009-10-06
  
  <<${df} 1.2.0>> has been released.
  
  We are pleased to let you know that our milestone journey towards next feature release is finally over. We've managed to do some minor enhancements to M3 as well as completing the {{{./tutorial/hellodao.html} Hello, DAO!}}
  tutorial. Check out the {{{./changes-report.html} changelog}} for more information about this release.
  
  As mentioned earlier, we are considering several unscheduled and experimental features in our {{{./roadmap.html} roadmap}}. In particular, we are currently working on {{{./sample/df-meets-flex.html} ${df} meets Flex}}
  sample application and the repository entity concept.
  
** ${df} meets Flex
  
  Our first non-trivial sample application consists of two parts:
  
  * <Server>
  
    * {{{http://static.springframework.org/spring/docs/2.5.x/reference/index.html} Spring}}
  
    * {{{http://static.springsource.org/spring-security/site/docs/2.0.x/reference/springsecurity.html} Spring Security}} with AspectJ security interceptor
  
    * {{{http://static.springsource.org/spring-flex/docs/1.0.x/reference/html/index.html} Spring BlazeDS Integration}}
  
    * declarative transaction management using AspectJ
  
    * service command pattern
  
    * declarative validation using annotations and AspectJ
  
  []
  
  * <Client>
  
    * {{{http://www.adobe.com/products/flex/} Flex}}
  
    * {{{http://code.google.com/p/swizframework/} Swiz}}
  
    * {{{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_view_controller} MVC pattern}}
  
  []
  
  Both parts are managed and built by {{{http://maven.apache.org/} Maven}}.
  
** Repository entity concept
  
  Imagine you take the DAO layer and merge it with your domain model - resulting entities are DAOs on their own. This reduces complexity of the application architecture but essentially
  ties persistence technologies with your domain model. We have a working concept of such entities and plan to provide official support for this alternative DAO approach in the future.
  
  We are also pleased that {{{http://code.google.com/p/m2-site-tools/} m2-site-tools}} is now {{{http://www.anasoft.com/en/press/ANASOFTpresentSecondOpenSourceProject-m2-site-tools.shtml} recognized}}
  as our second OpenSource project.
  
* 2009-09-14
  
  <<${df} milestone 3>> has been released. Changes include general Maven dependency cleanup and final touches to the bitemporal package. See the {{{./changes-report.html} changelog}}
  for more information about this milestone release.
  
  We've added some notes regarding unscheduled and experimental features to our {{{./roadmap.html} roadmap}}. More information on these will be given upon the final release.
  
  Please note that the reference FAQ has been temporarily removed and should be added later on.
  
* 2009-09-10
  
  We have finalized the reference documentation for the upcoming <<1.2.0>> release. ${df} milestone 3 will be out very soon, followed by the actual final release.
  
* 2009-08-24
  
  A new version of {{{http://code.google.com/p/m2-site-tools/} m2-site-tools}} has been officially released and linked to the {{{http://code.google.com/p/anasoft-os-repo/} ANASOFT OpenSource repository}}.
  
  We also added a new tech note called {{{./technote/temporal-aspects.html} Temporal Aspects in Domain Models}} which explains the bitemporal pattern using examples.
  
* 2009-08-14
  
  Michal created a {{{http://www.facebook.com/pages/Open-Source-DAO-FUSION/115735348805} Facebook page}} devoted to ${df}.
  
* 2009-08-12
  
  We've been experimenting with {{{http://www.google.com/friendconnect/} Google Friend Connect}} gadgets to add some nice social features to the project site. You can join and sign in to ${df}
  site community using the Members gadget located at the bottom of menu on the left side. After signing in, you can post comments and reviews to most of our pages.
  
  Work on ${df} milestone 3 nears to its end as well so stay tuned for the next release.
  
* 2009-07-21
  
  <<${df} milestone 2>> has been released. M2 features the long-awaited {{{http://groups.google.com/group/dao-fusion/browse_thread/thread/e1ece1641af9c970} bitemporal}}
  classes as well as other minor improvements. See the {{{./changes-report.html} changelog}} for more information about this milestone release.
  
  The reference documentation has been revised from the ground up to reflect the current state. As announced before, the {{{./reference/entity-criteria-api.html} entity criteria API}}
  embraced most changes during our refactoring. Igor started to work on the {{{./reference/bitemporal-pattern.html} bitemporal reference}} as well. The reference {{{./reference/reference-faq.html} FAQ}}
  is still halfway finished though and will be done in M3.
  
  The {{{./roadmap.html} roadmap}} has been updated too - we've decided to postpone the <Hello, DAO!> step-by-step tutorial in favor of finishing the reference documentation.
  We expect to deliver M3 in a couple of weeks or so, followed by <<1.2.0>> shortly thereafter.
  
* 2009-06-26
  
  Bitemporal classes begin to appear in <${df-core}> as Igor progresses with his bitemporal quest. We try to keep the <Hello, DAO!> sample application up to date with
  our changes for consistency. A good place to see the list of recent changes between milestones is the {{{./changes-report.html} changelog}}.
  
  We also updated some versions of libraries ${df} depends on as well as adding one new dependency - see the {{{./dependencies.html} dependencies}} page for more details.
  
* 2009-06-19
  
  We introduced ${df} to new {{{http://groups.adobe.com/posts/d917e57cbc} Slovakia FUG}} members during our quick Friday meeting.
  
* 2009-06-16
  
  <<${df} milestone 1>> has been released. M1 picked up all open issues except the {{{http://code.google.com/p/daofusion/issues/detail?id=9} bitemporal pattern}} support.
  See the {{{./changes-report.html} changelog}} for more information about this milestone release. {{{./tutorial/hellodao.html} Hello, DAO!}} tutorial has been migrated
  to M1 as well.
  
  Please note that the reference documentation is still applicable for <<1.1.1>> with minor enhancements introduced by M1 (anything that breaks the old API is not included).
  Complete revision of the reference documentation is scheduled for M2 - see the updated {{{./roadmap.html} roadmap}} for details.
  
* 2009-06-04
  
  Major code review and refactoring taking place all over ${df}. {{{./reference/entity-criteria-api.html} Persistent entity criteria API}} was revised from the ground up
  to allow even more flexibility and the ability to plug in your custom criterion implementations which seamlessly integrate with <<<NestedPropertyCriteria>>>.
  
* 2009-06-01
  
  We are progressing towards next feature release with first API changes introduced by {{{http://code.google.com/p/daofusion/issues/detail?id=8} Property path refactoring}}
  issue. <<${df} 1.2.0>> should pick up any issues that come up until the final release.
  
* 2009-05-25
  
  ${df} team is happy to announce the availability of {{{./tutorial/hellodao.html} Hello, DAO!}} tutorial. <Hello, DAO!> aims to help developers get familiar with ${df}
  concepts using popular web technologies and tools.
  
  We are currently preparing for a new feature release - see the {{{./roadmap.html} roadmap}} for more information about project milestones and their progress. Stay tuned,
  <<${df} 1.2.0>> is on its way!
  
* 2009-04-24
  
  <<${df} 1.1.1>> has been released. Check out the {{{./changes-report.html} changelog}} for more information about this release.
  
  There are several important things we want to point out in addition to the new release:
  
  * ${df} now has its own {{{./google-groups.html} discussion group}} hosted on {{{http://groups.google.com/} Google Groups}}. This is the place to discuss your questions,
    ideas, new features or known issues.
  
  []
  
  * There are discussions going on about the {{{http://groups.google.com/group/dao-fusion/browse_thread/thread/e1ece1641af9c970} bitemporal pattern}} which is intended
    to be part of ${df} 1.2 feature release (see the {{{http://groups.google.com/group/dao-fusion/browse_thread/thread/31ce6fa45f443f6c} Release notes thread}} for more
    information).
  
    <We would also like to encourage you to post any topics regarding possible functionality / API changes since now is the right time for such decisions (e.g. what you
    would like to see in the next feature release).>
  
  []
  
  Please note that this is essentially the last release of the 1.1.x branch.
  
* 2009-04-02
  
  ${df} site generation is now powered by {{{http://code.google.com/p/m2-site-tools/} m2-site-tools}}. The most notable change is the use of highlighted code snippets
  throughout the project documentation.
  
  ${df} and {{{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source_software} open source software}} were also key themes during our project presentation here at {{{http://www.anasoft.com/} ANASOFT}}.
  
* 2009-03-19
  
  <<${df} 1.1.0>> has been released.
  
  {{{./changes-report.html} Lots of changes}} and site updates in this release. ${df} also celebrates its first month of being publicly available!
  
* 2009-03-05
  
  ${df} was briefly mentioned at the {{{http://groups.adobe.com/posts/c39c490d91} Slovakia FUG meeting}} held at {{{http://www.fei.stuba.sk/generate_page.php?page_id=793} Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology}},
  Slovak University of Technology in Bratislava, Slovakia.
  
  During a short break, Vojtech summarized the benefits of {{{http://www.adobe.com/products/flex/} Flex}} / Java symbiosis as the next generation of rich internet applications.
  The FUG was led by our Flex enthusiasts {{{http://groups.adobe.com/people/7e5361c49f} Tegi}} and {{{http://groups.adobe.com/people/2c1bf4a17e} Eugen}}. A short promo of this
  meeting can be found {{{http://groups.adobe.com/posts/dc5aae5cf2} here}}.
  
* 2009-02-26
  
  <<${df} 1.0.1>> has been released.
  
  See the {{{./changes-report.html} changelog}} for more information about this release.
  
* 2009-02-18
  
  We have released ${df} as our contribution to the open-source Java community.
  
  <${df} aims to help Java developers build their server-side DAO layers with ease, doing most of the usual heavy lifting and providing support for common DAO-related tasks.
  ${df} introduces conventions and best practices into DAO layer development in terms of a consistent and extensible persistent entity model and standard persistent entity DAO
  interfaces / abstract implementations which already provide most of the usual DAO functionality. ${df} introduces the criteria transfer object (CTO) pattern which proves
  to be useful for application scenarios with loose coupling between the client and the server. Last but not least, ${df} provides an out-of-the-box integration test support
  that ensures proper test coverage of core DAO functionality and enables you to write your own custom integration tests for the chosen database at the same time.>
  
  The mission of ${df} is simple - <<build more reliable, maintainable and testable DAO layers>> using leading technologies such as {{{http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/J2EE/jpa/} Java Persistence API}}
  (JPA) and {{{http://www.hibernate.org/} Hibernate}}.
